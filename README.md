Implemented a Decision Tree classification model using scikit-learn's DecisionTreeClassifier class. Divided data into training and test subsets, fitting the model to the training data. Utilized the trained model to predict churn for customers in the test subset. Explored alternative decision tree models with varying maximum depths to compare their accuracy on the test subset data. Demonstrated proficiency in machine learning model implementation and evaluation using Python's scikit-learn library
